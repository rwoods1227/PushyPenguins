# AAPushyPenguins

## MVP
This project will clone a mini-game from mario party 5 called pushy-pushy penguins. It will need to have the abilty so fall into the water
or be pushed by penguin sprites into the water to lose. Deciding whether the game should survival mode where there are endless waves and points are gained
or if there is a timer and you have to survive for that amound of time.
